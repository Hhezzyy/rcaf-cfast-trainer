"""Test package for the RCAF CFAST trainer.

This package contains unit and integration tests for the mathematics
reasoning test and associated UI.  The tests are designed to run
headlessly using pygame's dummy video driver to avoid opening real
windows.  To run these tests, execute ``pytest`` from the project root.
